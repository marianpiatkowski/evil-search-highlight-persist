#+TITLE: Emacs Evil-Search-Highlight-Persist Minor Mode

This is a fork of the [[https://github.com/juanjux/evil-search-highlight-persist][original]], unmaintained, evil-search-highlight-persist.

This Emacs extension will make =isearch= and =evil-ex-search-incremental= (the "slash
search") to highlight the search term (taken as a regexp) in all the buffer and
persistently until you make another search or clear the highlights with the
search-highlight-persist-remove-all command (default binding to =C-x SPC=). This
is how Vim search works by default when you enable hlsearch. This extension requires the
"highlight" extension.

* Usage

To enable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'highlight)
(require 'evil-search-highlight-persist)
(global-evil-search-highlight-persist t)
#+END_SRC

To only highlight strings whose length is great than or equal to 3

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq evil-search-highlight-string-min-len 3)
#+END_SRC

To change the default highlight face:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-face-background 'evil-ex-lazy-highlight "gold")
(set-face-foreground 'evil-ex-lazy-highlight "black")
#+END_SRC

To enable highlighting ( and un-highlighting ) across *all* windows, similiar
to what Vim does:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq evil-search-highlight-persist-all-windows t)
#+END_SRC

* Alternatives

This behavior is built-in to Evil if one if using the evil-search module:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq evil-search-module 'evil-search)
#+END_SRC
However, this is not available when using isearch, which I beleive provides a
superior searching experience. This package also provides the benefit of being
able to highlight all current windows, simliar to what Vim does.

In my opinion, this package would be made obsolete if evil-search was tweaked to
behave [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/813][more like isearch]], and once evil supports [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/805][highlighting across all windows]].
